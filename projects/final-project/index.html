<p>Greek life has gained a reputation for hazing, and over the years numerous students have died as a result. But if so many students are being badly injured or even killed, then what have the higher education system and even the United States done to evade these tragedies?</p>
<h3>What is Hazing </h3>
<p>In a study conducted by <a href="https://doi-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/10.1515/ijamh.2012.012">Walter de Gruyter</a>, looking at the nature of hazing, hazing was described as a form of “interpersonal violence.” It goes on to say hazing is, “generally defined as any activity expected of someone joining or participating in a group… that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers regardless of a person’s willingness to participate.”  
While most recognizable in a fraternity setting or context, hazing is commonplace among sports teams or honor societies.   
</p>
<h3>Who participates in hazing</h3>
<p>According to the study students who participate in hazing, which is criminal activity, don’t label it as such. And as a result they often discount its potential harm, thus likely leading to its continued prevalence.<br> 
“Data collected from middle school and high school athletes in the suburbs of New York  city  found that 17.4% had been subjected to practices that would qualify as hazing.”
</p>
<h3>What does hazing look like?</h3>
<p>There is no allencompacing act that describes hazing as a whole. There are numerous genres of behaviors that are attributed to hazing. According to that same study outlines beating, paddling, whipping and striking; blood pinning; branding, cigarette burning and burning; confinement to restricted areas; blunt trauma from  falls after having to climb roofs, ledges and bridges; immersion in noxious substances; psychological abuse; and sexual assaults. </p>

<h3>Laws Against Hazing</h3>

<p>There is no national law for or against hazing though 44 states do have differing laws against it. Laws are dependent upon numerous factors some stipulate that without physical harm or substantial bodily harm hazing is considered a misdemeanor. Others mention emotional distress as cause for prosecution. In most of the states that constitute hazing being a felony, death as a result of hazing is a stipulation. While others lump bullying in with it, along with grade school being mentioned within the context of the legal writing. Hawaii is one of the states that does not have a law against hazing passed, though a bill was drafted to circumvent these findings. While it has not passed as of yet the bill mentioned the organization aptly named <a href="https://stophazing.org/">“StopHazing”</a> as a reasoning for the bill’s making.

<p>According to a 2000 study on hazing among high school students, 25% of students reported experiencing some form of hazing prior to being 13 years old. The study also found that drastic change indicative of a “breakdown of tradition” is needed. Hazing is deeply rooted as a cultural phenomena and a tradition the likes of which are often hard to break out of.

<p>
In 2015 the University of Maryland passed an updated hazing policy that allows students anonymously report hazing taking place around campus. The policy outlines, “aggravated violations of this policy, as defined in... the Code of Student Conduct, normally result in suspension or expulsion of the responsible student from the University.”
