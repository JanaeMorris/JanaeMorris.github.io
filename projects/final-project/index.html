<h1>Hazing In America</h1>
<!--I intend to make the title flip through Greek characters before landing on the actual title (Almost an animation)-->
<h5>By Janae Morris</h5>

<p>Greek life has gained a reputation for hazing, and over the years numerous students have died as a result. Thus, garnering media attention. Students who are in or work with a Greek life organization, don’t seem to qualify their behavior as hazing.  </p>
<h3>What is hazing </h3>
<p>In a study conducted by <a href="https://doi-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/10.1515/ijamh.2012.012">Walter de Gruyter</a>, looking at the nature of hazing, hazing was described as a form of “interpersonal violence.” It goes on to say hazing is, “generally defined as any activity expected of someone joining or participating in a group… that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers regardless of a person’s willingness to participate.”  
While most recognizable in a fraternity setting or context, hazing is commonplace among sports teams or honor societies.   
</p>
<h3>Who participates in hazing</h3>
<p>According to the study students who participate in hazing, which is criminal activity, don’t label it as such. And as a result they often discount its potential harm, thus likely leading to its continued prevalence.<br> 
“Data collected from middle school and high school athletes in the suburbs of New York  city  found that 17.4% had been subjected to practices that would qualify as hazing.”
</p>
<h3>What does hazing look like?</h3>
<p>There is no allencompacing act that describes hazing as a whole. There are numerous genres of behaviors that are attributed to hazing. According to that same study outlines beating, paddling, whipping and striking; blood pinning; branding, cigarette burning and burning; confinement to restricted areas; blunt trauma from  falls after having to climb roofs, ledges and bridges; immersion in noxious substances; psychological abuse; and sexual assaults. </p>
